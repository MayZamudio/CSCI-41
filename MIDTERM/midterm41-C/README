This program will read a series of integers and letters from the standard
input in any order. It will then put them into a set and a vector,
respectively. I.e. all integers read will go into the set, and all characters
read will go into the vector.

It will then output the set (in sorted order, automatically, since it's a
sorted set), and then the vector in the order the characters were entered. It
then sorts the vector, and outputs the vector in sorted order one final time.

You need to fix the compile time bug which prevents it from compiling, and the
logic bug which prevents it from working properly (test the code! You'll see
that it's not working as described above).

Don't worry about negative numbers.

Sample Run:
Please enter letters or numbers to add to our data structures. (0 to quit):
9 G 20 A 16 C Z R Q 1 0
The set contains:
1
9
16
20
The vector contains:
G
A
C
Z
R
Q
The sorted vector contains:
A
C
G
Q
R
Z
