=====================================

This is a simple program that uses a custom Class to generate random colors
(colors are represented by Red, Green, and Blue and range from 0 to 255). The
system can mix colors together (adding their components) or can sort a vector
of colors in one of three ways (by red, by green, or by blue). The system uses
this to identify the most and least red and green and blue colors out of the
10 colors randomly generated.

The system uses a random seed to generate the colors. That part works fine -
don't mess with it or it'll break the autograder.
