Some people think BRIDGES is hard to use. This code will show you how easy it
is to make a singly linked list in BRIDGES and visualize it on their web site.

The notion is that we're dealing cards from a deck in a Blackjack sort of
game, and we want to visualize our hand (held in a linked list), so we use
BRIDGES to do it.

We also calculate the point total of our hand.

Be sure to put in your BRIDGES credentials if you want to view the linked list
we build.

Use "make" to build the project. Admire the master Makefile after the
midterm is over. If you get a lot of error messages, remember you can use
'more' to show one page of errors at a time, like this:
make |& more
