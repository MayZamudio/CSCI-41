This is a simple program. The user will be prompted to enter 0s and 1s. He or
she will do so all in one long block, like this: 001110011

The program will store the bits in a linked list.

You can hit return or enter a non-binary number to stop data entry.

The program will then output the total number of bits read, and the total
number of 1s read and the total number of zeroes.

Sample input and output:

Insert a series of 1s and 0s (anything else to quit): 111000
You entered 6 bits, of which 3 were ones and 3 were zeroes.

Insert a series of 1s and 0s (anything else to quit): 01110001101101
You entered 14 bits, of which 8 were ones and 6 were zeroes.

Insert a series of 1s and 0s (anything else to quit): 11AB00
You entered 2 bits, of which 2 were ones and 0 were zeroes.

Insert a series of 1s and 0s (anything else to quit):
You entered 0 bits, of which 0 were ones and 0 were zeroes.
