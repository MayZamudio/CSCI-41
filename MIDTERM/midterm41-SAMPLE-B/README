This program is a simple calculator to compute the average score of your
favorite baseball team.

The user will first enter how many games were played (which has to be an
unsigned integer - playing -54 games makes literally no sense). If the user
typed in a number below 1 or over 100 or anything invalid, it quits. 

The program will then input that many unsigned integers, corresponding to the
score in each game. The minimum score is 0, the maximum score is 100.

The program will then compute the average score by adding up all the scores
into a double and then dividing by the number of games played.
