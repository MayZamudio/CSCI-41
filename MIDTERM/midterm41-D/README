Purpose: To teach you guys about BSTs, especially debugging them.

This code builds two templated BSTs, one for ints, one for strings.

It inserts into them, and outputs the sorted results.

Rules:
1) Duplicates are discarded.
2) If the tree is empty, it will print "Tree Empty."
3) THE TREE SHOULD BE SORTED FROM SMALLEST TO LARGEST.
4) You should have no memory leaks in your code.
