===================

You have to write a program that does an RPN calculator.

2 3 + 4 * is the same thing as (2+3)*4

Rules:

1) Every time you read an int in from cin, it gets pushed on a stack of ints.

2) Every time you read an operation in from cin, it will pop off two elements
from the stack, do the computation, and push the result back. You must
support the following operations: +,-,*,/,%,^

3) If they type "E", then if and only if the stack has exactly ONE element on
it, print the value on the stack, otherwise die.

4) You must do error checking - if the stack gets emptied out by an operation,
die. If they type E with the size of the stack not equal to one, die. If they
don't type E ever, then die. (I.e. all input must have at least one E in it.)

To die, print "BAD INPUT!" and quit. The die() function is written for you.

Note: You can use either the standard library stack class or write your own.
