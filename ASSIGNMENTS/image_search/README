=========================================================================

Purpose: This assignment will teach you about pointers, classes, data
structures, and making good tests for yourself.

Location: All of your coding will be done in "you.cc". Don't modify main.cc.

Objective: For this assignment you will implement a simple image recognition library. You
must scan through an image to find all blue pixels and return the x,y
coordinate of the center of all of them. 

Consider this image:

It has a red square, a purple polygon, and a blue circle. Your program should
return the x,y coordinates of the center of the circle. x is horizontal, y is
vertical. 0,0 is the top left corner of the image.

Images are 3D arrays of color data. The x and y coordinates are the x and
y coordinates of the image. The z axis is color. The first color is red, the
second green, the third blue. You will be given a 1D array containing color
data. These are all unsigned chars, with 0 meaning black and 255 meaning full
color.

Example. Suppose I give you a 3x3 pixel image (this is a very small image!)
that has a single purple (255 red, 0 green, 255 blue) pixel in the bottom left
corner. If I was to draw what this array would look like in 3D, it'd be
something like this:

Red Plane:
0	0	0
0	0	0
255 0	0

Green Plane:
0	0	0
0	0	0
0	0	0

Blue Plane:
0	0	0
0	0	0
255 0	0

But of course it would be too easy to give you a data structure with the data
organized as all this. All you are going to get is what *I* got when I started
work on this assignment, which is a pointer to a 1D array holding all of that
data in order. Read from left to right, like a book, and those numbers above
look like this:
0	0	0	0	0	0	255	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0
0	0	0	0	255	0	0

Every three numbers (the width of the image in my example) is a new row. Every
three times three numbers (the width x the height) is a new color. 

1) You will be given a pointer to the start of this chunk of memory, the
width, and the height. I recommend making a vector or something to store the
data in, or write a function to be able to select the color data at a given x
and y location. 

2) Loop over the image and record the location of every blue pixel. "Blue" means the
blue value at a pixel is between 236 and 255, and its red and green values at
that point are both below 20.

I recommend you find very small sample images to test your code on. This is an
integral part of the "learning to be a programmer" process - finding good
tests to test your code on. Here's one I found that might be helpful -

3) Output to the standard output the (x,y) location of the center of all blue
pixels in the image, like this: "The center point for blue in this image is:
(49,49)". If there is no blue at all in the image, print: "No blue found."
