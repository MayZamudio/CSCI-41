=======================================================================

The US Government has tasked you with programming "COVID CONNECT", a program
that will connect people with businesses that produce the resources they need
to stay alive, like toilet paper and food. Your company (Covid Connect) has a
fleet of drones used to make the deliveries, and will make its money that way.

In order to get paid, your program must successfully implement the following
three functions:

1) The ability to ADD PEOPLE and BUSINESSES to a database. All people and
businesses have a name (a string of one or more words), and an X and Y
location (both long longs), and a bank account balance (a long long) in cents.

2) The ability to ADD ITEMS that a business has for sale. Every item to
purchase has a name (a string, that must be unique) and a price (a long long) in
cents.

3) The ability for a customer to BUY an item from a business. The
customer must specify the item to buy, and money equal to the cost is
transferred from the customer to the business. The customer pays a delivery
fee equal to the number of miles they are from the business to us (Covid
Connect), with a minimum fee of $5. Round all floats to the nearest int.
(Example: a person at (10,10) buys a roll of toilet paper from a business at
(20,21). This is 14.87 miles away, so we charge $15.)

When the user of the program chooses to QUIT, the program prints some final stats
and then quits.  It first prints the name and account balance of the richest
person and the richest business. It then prints how much money Covid Connect
(your company) has grossed in total.

If an error occurs, print "BAD INPUT!\n" and quit.

Errors:
1) A person tries to buy something they don't have enough money for.
2) If a person and/or business is added that has the same name as another one.
(If a person named Kerney exists, there cannot be another person named Kerney
but there could be a business named Kerney or an item named Kerney.)
3) If a business tries to buy something. (I know that in real life business to
business is a big deal, but we're keeping it simple here.) More generally
speaking, if the name of the person trying to buy something isn't in the
database of persons.
4) If a business tries adding something for sale that has the same name as
something else for sale. (If you have kimchi for sale, you cannot add kimchi
for sale again.)
5) Any negative price or negative starting account balance is an error.
6) A sale from more than 100 miles away is an error. (100 miles is okay, 101
miles is an error.)
7) Entering a choice other than 1 to 5 from the main menu

Sample Run #3. Tran and H Wolf live at opposite sides of Fresno, at (10,10) and (-10,-10) respectively. There are two game stores in town, Toys R Us (0,0) and Crazy Squirrel (-10,0). They each buy an item from both stores, and despite both starting with the same amount of money, H Wolf ends up with more due to him living closer to the Squirrel.
