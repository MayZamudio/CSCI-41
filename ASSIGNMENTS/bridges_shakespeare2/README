Do the same as the last one except make a heap and insert / pop off of that
instead of using a vector.

You have to make a templated Heap class, you can't use priority_queue, that
would be too easy. The class must have at least two functions:
1. Push
2. Pop

You can/should use a vector as the backing store for the Heap class.

There's four lines of code you need to change from the old one to make it use
a heap instead of vector:
1) Change vector to Heap
2) Call heap::push instead of vector::push_back
3) No need to call sort any more because you're a super cool heap
4) Call heap::pop instead of vector.at(i) to copy into the BRIDGES Array1D
