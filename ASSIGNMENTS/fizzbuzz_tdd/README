=================================================

This is a simple warmup programming assignment designed to get you used to
doing development here on the server. It will also teach you the TDD
development method.

You're responsible for writing two functions and testing them:
fizzbuzz
fizzbuzz2

Fizzbuzz is a function that will take a number between 1 and 100, and will
return a string containing one of four values based on which case it is:
Case 1) "Fizz" if the number passed in is divisible by 3 (for example, 12).
Case 2) "Buzz" if the number passed in is divisible by 5 (for example, 20).
Case 3) "Fizzbuzz" if the number passed in is divisible by both 3 and 5 (for example
30).
Case 4) "<The number>" otherwise. (for example, passing in 7 will return "7"). This is
a string, not an int. To convert from an int to a string in C++, use the
to_string() function. For example, to_string(2) returns "2".

Fizzbuzz2 is exactly the same, but with one additional check.
Prior to Case 4, you must add the digits of the number together, and apply the
same checks to the sum. In other words, if you pass in 41, you will return
"Buzz" because even though 41 isn't divisble by 3 or 5, 4+1 = 5. You will add
this check after Case 3 and before Case 4.

You must write a series of tests for your code to verify that your code is
working properly. I recommend starting with the simplest tests possible, and
writing as little code as possible to answer those tests, and continuing to go
back and forth until you can't think of anything else to test.

Use "make" to compile this code, rather than trying to compile it manually.
