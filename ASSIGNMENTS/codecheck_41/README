====================================================

For this assignment, you will do them online rather than on the server. I made
five exercises for you to do. Go to the website, and you will see there is
missing code. Fill in the missing code. Simple. Or is it? 

1 through 3 are on linked lists, 4 and 5 on BSTs.

When you finish, save the zip file it proves you as proof of completion and
attach it on Canvas to me, and note which exercises you did.
