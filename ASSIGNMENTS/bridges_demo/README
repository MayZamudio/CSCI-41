For this assignment, we will be using a tool called BRIDGES developed by
Kalpathi Subramanian at UNC Charlotte.

It comes with a bunch of data structures that are already written, and has
tools for visualizing those data structures.

Main web site: http://bridgesuncc.github.io/
Tutorials: http://bridgesuncc.github.io/Hello_World_Tutorials/Overview.html
Original Paper: https://kosara.net/papers/2016/Burlinson-SIGCSE-2016.pdf

1) STEP 1 - You need to register on their web site (see link above). This will
give you a username and API key (which works like a password.

2) STEP 2 - Open up one of the demo source code files in this local directory,
and replace YOUR_USERNAME and YOUR_API_KEY with the username and API key you
got from the website.

3) Compile. It needs the curl library linked in, so to compile it manually you
need to type (example is using circ_dllist.cc):
g++ circ_dllist.cc -lcurl

**I would recommend making a Makefile instead to automate your builds**

4) Run (type "a.out")

If you get a message saying you need to enter your name and API key, that
means you need to enter your name and API key (see step 2). You can't run this
code until you've registered on their web site and gotten a username and API
key.

5) Go onto the website and log in here:
http://bridges-cs.herokuapp.com/login

Each project has a different project number (it's located before YOUR_USERNAME
and YOU_API_KEY). This separates out the projects on the web site. Click on
the project number and it will show you the visualization for that project.

Pretty sweet, isn't it?

======

When you're ready to experiment on your own, pick a data structure of theirs
you want to play with, a list of which is here:
http://bridgesuncc.github.io/doc/cxx-api/current/html/annotated.html

Then call this line at the top:
Bridges *bridges =  new Bridges(222, "YOUR_USERNAME", "YOUR_API_KEY");
(Replace 222 with whatever project number you want to use)

And then at the end:
bridges->setDataStructure(arr);
bridges->visualize();
(Replace arr with whatever BRIDGES data structure you want to visualize.)
