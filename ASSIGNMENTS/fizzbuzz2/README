In this directory is a file called fizzbuzz.cc. It is an empty file, that you will need to write from scratch.

It will need to do the following:
1) Print the numbers from 1 to 100, each on its own line.
2) Instead of printing a number divisible by 3, print "Fizz" instead
3) Instead of printing a number divisible by 5, print "Buzz" instead
4) Instead of printing a number divisible by both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz" instead

Sample output should look like:
1
2
Fizz
4
Buzz
Fizz
7
8
Fizz
Buzz
...and so forth

When it is working correctly, just leave it in that directory. It will be collected and graded automatically when the midterm is over.
