=====================

Purpose: To teach you about writing networked code and NCURSES.

Partners: This is an open ended, partnered assignment. You can have one
person do the server, one do the client, or split it up however you want.

Use the code in ~/network_demo as a basis for this code. Or not. It's your
life.

5 bullet points to get an A. Each bullet point you do is a letter grade.

1) You have a server that allows exactly two clients to connect. The server
must take the commands from a client, making sure that a client can't move
twice in a row. 

2) You have a client that will display your local ships and what you know of
the enemy (water, hits, misses). It must talk to the server to send where it
is shooting torpedos, and receive from the server where the enemy is shooting
and reply with HIT or MISS. (Don't cheat.)

3) Use NCURSES to display both screens. 10x10 grids. Use letters for columns
and numbers for rows. Here's a good book on NCURSES a student told me about:

4) Implement the game of battleship. There is a setup phase in which you place
your ships on a 2D grid. Then there is a phase where you send a Row and Column
to your opponent (using the server) and they will respond with HIT or MISS.

5) Detect the end of the game. Print a win message using figlet. Reset the
world so you can either play again or quit.

EXTRA CREDIT: Each one of these is an extra letter grade. 

EC1) BATTLESLOOP BATTLE ROYAL. Allow up to 100 players in the same game.

EC2) Allow ships to move around and shoot. You might need to have some sort of
fog of war / radar system if you let them move so the game isn't stupid.

EC3) Mouse support. The client already has mouse support turned on in NCURSES,
but it currently doesn't do anything more than read the row and column clicked
on.

EC4) Implement Battlestar Galactica or Cosmic Encounter instead of Battleship.
**This is two extra letter grades.**
